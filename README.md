Pneumonia Detection using Chest X-Rays and concepts of Transfer Learning


The Pneumonia Detection Project using Transfer Learning with Pytorch and ResNet50 pre-trained model is a deep learning project aimed at detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The project uses transfer learning to leverage the pre-trained ResNet50 model, which has been trained on a large dataset, and fine-tunes it on a smaller dataset of chest X-ray images to classify them as normal or pneumonia.

The advantages of this project are:

High Accuracy: Transfer learning with pre-trained models has been shown to achieve high accuracy in classification tasks, and this project leverages that to accurately detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

Faster Training: Using a pre-trained model can significantly reduce the training time required to achieve good results compared to training a model from scratch.

Reduced Resource Requirements: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model requires fewer computational resources and less data than training a model from scratch, making this project more accessible to researchers with limited resources.

Generalization: The pre-trained model has already learned many features that are useful for image classification tasks, which enables it to generalize well to new datasets.

Real-world Impact: Accurately detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images can aid in the early detection and treatment of the disease, potentially saving lives and reducing healthcare costs.
